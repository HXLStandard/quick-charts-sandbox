# quick-charts-sandbox
Sandbox for developing JSON "bites" for HDX Quick Charts (for HXL data).

This is a simple, browser-side sandbox for experimenting with JSON configuration files (bites) for HDX Quick Charts. There is no public documentation available yet for the config files, but a sample will appear in the app when you open it in a browser. 

You can also use this tool online at
